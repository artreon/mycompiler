# langproc-2017-cw-art116

to run:
```
$ make bin/simplething
$ ./bin/simplething
```

reads from the file simplecode.txt and identifies tokens which are printed

-------------------
Need to implement:

- flesh out parser and lexer to include more types (float, double, consts), void functions

- AST: one AST with two cpp files for code gen and translation?
